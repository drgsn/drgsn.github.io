[{"content":"How to create blog for free with Hugo and GitHub I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to start a blog and what better hello world post than how I\u0026rsquo;ve set it up. But first lets talk about what is Hugo.\nWhat is Hugo?  2560px-Logo_of_Hugo_the_static_website_generator.svg.png \nAccording to their site Hugo is a fast and modern static site generator written in Go, and designed to make website creation fun again.\nPut it in layman terms Hugo is a tool that generates a full static HTML website based on raw data and a set of templates. Essentially, Hugo automates the task of coding individual HTML pages and gets those pages ready to serve to users ahead of time.\nThe raw data is the content you write in Markdown, a format that widely used in lots of editors.\nThe template is the theme that you chose for your site.\nMy process for writing a blog post is:\n write a post using Notion export the content to a markdown file then commit the file to a GitHub repository using GitHub Actions, deploy the changes to a repository created for GitHub Pages.  Install Hugo The first think we need to do is to install the Hugo CLI, to be able to test locally our changes before pushing them to Github. Depending on your operating system you need to do the following:\nMac OS: If you use Homebrew, run the brew install command in your terminal to install Hugo:\nbrew install hugo or if you use MacPorts run the following command:\nport install hugo To validate the installation run:\nhugo version Windows: There are 2 methods of installing Hugo on windows:\nMethod 1 - Using Chocolatey: choco install hugo --confirm # Or if you need the “extended” Sass/SCSS version: choco install hugo-extended -confirm Method 2 - Manual Installation The Hugo GitHub repository contains pre-built versions of the Hugo command-line tool for various operating systems, which can be found on the Releases page.\nFor more instruction on installing these releases, refer to Hugo\u0026rsquo;s install guide.\nLinux Based on your operating system you can use one of the following commands:\n# Debian / Ubuntu sudo apt-get install hugo # Arch / Manjaro sudo pacman -Syu hugo # Fedora, Red Hat and CentOS sudo dnf install hugo For other distributions or operating systems visit the Hugo\u0026rsquo;s install guide.\nCreate a Hugo site Now that you have Hugo install is time to create your own site by running:\nhugo new site myblog Now that the site is created, comes the hardest part. Picking up a theme. This is the steps were I\u0026rsquo;ve spend the most time on and probably the part of my blog were i tinker the most.\n","date":"2020-10-01T00:00:00Z","image":"https://drgos.com/p/hello-world/the-creative-exchange-d2zvqp3fpro-unsplash_huf941de4769045cdfa8c9ee7036519a2a_35369_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://drgos.com/p/hello-world/","title":"Hello World"},{"content":"Hugo ships with several Built-in Shortcodes for rich content, along with a Privacy Config and a set of Simple Shortcodes that enable static and no-JS versions of various social media embeds.\n YouTube Privacy Enhanced Shortcode    Twitter Simple Shortcode .twitter-tweet { font: 14px/1.45 -apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,\"Segoe UI\",Roboto,Oxygen-Sans,Ubuntu,Cantarell,\"Helvetica Neue\",sans-serif; border-left: 4px solid #2b7bb9; padding-left: 1.5em; color: #555; } .twitter-tweet a { color: #2b7bb9; text-decoration: none; } blockquote.twitter-tweet a:hover, blockquote.twitter-tweet a:focus { text-decoration: underline; }  “In addition to being more logical, asymmetry has the advantage that its complete appearance is far more optically effective than symmetry.”\n— Jan Tschichold pic.twitter.com/gcv7SrhvJb\n\u0026mdash; Graphic Design History (@DesignReviewed) January 17, 2019  Vimeo Simple Shortcode  .__h_video { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.23%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; background: #000; } .__h_video img { width: 100%; height: auto; color: #000; } .__h_video .play { height: 72px; width: 72px; left: 50%; top: 50%; margin-left: -36px; margin-top: -36px; position: absolute; cursor: pointer; }  ","date":"2019-03-10T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://drgos.com/p/rich-content/","title":"Rich Content"}]
