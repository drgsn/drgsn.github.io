This is a creational type pattern and this pattern provides one of the best ways to create different objects without exposing the creation logic and exposing it using a common interface.
To make it easier to understand, think of a car factory. The car factory produces multiple car types, but you don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly how the cars are produced, how much of the underlying technology and components they share, but you don&amp;rsquo;t care about that.</description></item><item><title>Design Patterns Intro</title><link>https://drgos.com/p/design-patterns-intro/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://drgos.com/p/design-patterns-intro/</guid><description>There is an old saying, &amp;ldquo;If the only tool you have is a hammer, you will start treating all your problems like a nail.‚Äù
This quote dates back to 1964 and Abraham Kaplan, whose first wording was actually:
&amp;ldquo;Give a small boy a hammer and he will find that everything he encounters needs a pounding.&amp;rdquo;
I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that in Software Engineering interviews there is a big accent on algorithms and data structures, but not on design patterns, at least not when you are starting out.</description></item></channel></rss>
