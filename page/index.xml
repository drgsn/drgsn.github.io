While I&amp;rsquo;m a proficient full-stack developer, my expertise is in building scalable backend services (API services, stream processing, and async mechanisms).
I love building things. While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle, I&amp;rsquo;m most attracted to solving real customer problems with a business justification. I&amp;rsquo;m looking for a senior individual contributor role where I can take on on collaborative team leadership responsibilites, and gain experience with architecture and project management.</description></item><item><title>Archives</title><link>https://drgos.com/archives/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://drgos.com/archives/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Search</title><link>https://drgos.com/search/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://drgos.com/search/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
